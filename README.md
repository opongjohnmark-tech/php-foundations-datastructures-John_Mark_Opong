Project Purpose
This project demonstrates two fundamental programming concepts in PHP: hash tables and recursion. The hash table example shows how data can be efficiently stored
and accessed using associative arrays, while the recursion example demonstrates how functions can call themselves to perform repeated tasks. The main.php file 
serves as the entry point that connects both features.

How to Run Each Part

The main.php file acts as the main controller that runs both the hash table and recursion scripts together. It includes or requires the other two PHP files
and executes their functions sequentially to display the combined output.
The hashtable.php file runs independently to demonstrate how data is inserted, searched, and displayed using a hash table structure.
The recursive.php file executes a recursive function that performs a specific task (such as calculating factorials or traversing data)
to show how recursion works in PHP. Each file can be run individually to observe its behavior, or all can be executed together through main.php.
